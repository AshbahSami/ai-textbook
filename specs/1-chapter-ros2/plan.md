# Chapter Plan: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Branch**: `1-chapter-ros2` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: [specs/1-chapter-ros2/spec.md](specs/1-chapter-ros2/spec.md)
**Input**: Chapter specification from `specs/1-chapter-ros2/spec.md`

## Summary

This chapter will introduce the foundational concepts of the Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2), establishing the software communication framework for the humanoid system. It will cover the core primitives of ROS 2, including Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions, and provide a pedagogical implementation guide for intermediate technical learners.

## Technical Context

**Authoring Language**: Markdown with Docusaurus front-matter
**Primary Tools**: Docusaurus, ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy (for examples)
**Testing**: Manual review and validation of code examples
**Target Platform**: Web (via Docusaurus)
**Project Type**: Educational Documentation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **AI-Native Documentation:** The chapter content will be generated and structured using AI-native tools.
- **Actionable Knowledge Base:** The content will be optimized for machine readability and retrieval.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** This chapter provides the first layer of the system architecture.
- **Technical Accuracy Standard:** All code and technical details will be verified against ROS 2 Foxy documentation.
- **Modular Structure Standard:** The chapter is the first of four distinct modules.
- **Tool-Specific Format:** The output will be compatible with the specified generative tools.
- **Documentation Platform Standard:** All output will be Docusaurus-compatible Markdown.
