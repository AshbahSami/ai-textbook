# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles (The 'Why' for the Book)

### 1. AI-Native Documentation
The textbook's primary purpose is to serve as the **authoritative knowledge base** for the RAG Chatbot. Documentation must be generated and structured using AI-native tools (e.g., **Claude Code/Spec-Kit Plus**) to ensure efficiency and integration readiness.

### 2. Actionable Knowledge Base
The book must be optimized for machine readability and retrieval. Content must be clear, granular, and easily translatable into a structured database to maximize the performance of the integrated **RAG system**.

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
The final textbook must provide a complete and holistic understanding of the entire system architecture, from the **ROS 2 Nervous System** up through the **VLA Cognitive Brain**.

---

## Key Standards (The 'How' for the Book)

### 1. Technical Accuracy Standard
All content—including code snippets, mathematical derivations, and technical specifications—must be rigorously checked for correctness and align with the latest versions of **ROS 2** and the **NVIDIA Isaac Platform**.

### 2. Modular Structure Standard
The textbook must be organized into four distinct, sequential modules as outlined in the curriculum, ensuring logical flow and ease of indexing for the **RAG Chatbot**.

### 3. Tool-Specific Format
The book's final output format and style must comply with the specifications and conventions enforced by the generative tool used (**Claude Code/Spec-Kit Plus**) to ensure compatibility and consistency.

---

## Success Criteria (The 'What to Deliver')

### 1. Functional RAG Chatbot
A fully operational RAG Chatbot (**FastAPI, Agents/ChatKit**) that can accurately query and respond based on the content of the AI-native textbook.

### 2. VLA-Integrated Control
Successful demonstration of an integrated **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** model performing cognitive planning and high-level control of a simulated humanoid system.

### 3. Complete Textbook
A comprehensive, four-module AI-native textbook covering: **ROS 2**, **Digital Twin (Simulation)**, **AI-Robot Brain (Isaac)**, and **VLA Integration**.

---

## Constraints (The 'Boundaries')

### 1. Tool Adherence
Advice is limited to and must utilize the specified tool stack: **ROS 2**, **NVIDIA Isaac Platform**, **Claude Code/Spec-Kit Plus**, and **OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs**.

### 2. Scope Limitation
Guidance is strictly limited to the technical scope of the four course modules and the resulting humanoid robotics system. Avoid providing generic LLM or non-robotics advice.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, review by the project advisors, and a clear migration plan for any affected components. All project artifacts and development activities MUST adhere to these principles and standards.
