## Prompt

/sp.plan

**Topic:** Book Introduction: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (The Conceptual Blueprint)

### 1. Architecture Overview (Conceptual Flow)
The introduction must be architected as a logical narrative that transitions the reader from the high-level philosophical shift in AI to the book's specific, actionable goal.
* **Flow:** The flow must progress from: **Global Context $\rightarrow$ The Physical Challenge $\rightarrow$ The Embodied Solution (The Book's Goal)**.
* **Purpose:** To frame the textbook not merely as a technical manual, but as the essential guide for mastering the next significant paradigm shift in AI development.

---

### 2. Implementation Phases (Writing Steps)
The writing process for the introduction should proceed in phases to ensure maximum impact:

1.  **Phase 1: The Visionary Hook:** Draft an opening paragraph that immediately captures the reader by defining the "future of AI" and the necessity of Physical AI systems.
2.  **Phase 2: Defining the Gap:** Clearly and forcefully articulate the core problem: **Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body.**
3.  **Phase 3: The Solution Pillars:** Introduce and name the specific technologies that serve as the foundation of the book's solution (**ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac**).
4.  **Phase 4: The Promise:** Conclude with a strong, concise statement summarizing the capstone experience and the specific skill the reader will gain (controlling humanoid robots).

---

### 3. Component Breakdown (Content Blocks)
The introduction must be composed of these distinct, high-impact content blocks:

* **The Global Thesis:** The statement that AI extends "beyond digital spaces into the physical world."
* **The Mission Statement:** The explicit **Goal** statement: "Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body."
* **The Technology Stack:** A single paragraph or bulleted list naming the core technologies (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac).
* **The Outcome:** The summary of the capstone experience (design, simulate, deploy humanoid robots).

---

### 4. Sequencing (Logical Flow)
The content must be structured in the following precise order for maximum effect:

1.  **Paragraph 1:** The future of AI and the introduction of Physical AI.
2.  **Paragraph 2:** The fundamental challenge and the **Goal** (Bridging the Gap / Embodied Intelligence).
3.  **Paragraph 3:** The Quarter Overview and the essential tools used to achieve the goal (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac).
4.  **Paragraph 4:** The final, powerful summary of the student's expected mastery and outcome.

---

### 5. Design Decisions (Tone and Style)
The writing must adhere to the following stylistic choices:

* **Tone:** Inspirational, academic, and forward-looking. Avoid overly casual language.
* **Language:** Use strong, active verbs and maintain a high-level, strategic vocabulary.
* **Pacing:** The text should be concise, moving quickly to the core mission statement to maintain the reader's attention.

## Sub-Chapter Structure for Introduction

For the writing process, the Introduction should utilize the following internal heading structure:

| Internal Section | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **I.1** | **The Next Frontier: AI Systems in the Physical World** |
| **I.2** | **The Challenge of Embodied Intelligence** |
| **I.3** | **Our Approach: The Capstone Quarter and Technology Pillars** |

## Response snapshot

Created implementation plan for the book introduction chapter, updated `specs/1-book-intro-physical-ai/plan.md`, and confirmed no additional artifacts were needed.
