## Prompt

Please add the following constraint to the existing, active /sp.constitution under the Key Standards section: . '''Documentation Platform Standard: All final documentation output (the textbook chapters) must be rendered into Markdown files that strictly adhere to the file naming and front-matter conventions required for publishing on the Docusaurus documentation framework. This ensures the content is ready for immediate deployment as a web-based document.'''

## Response snapshot

I have successfully updated the project constitution to version 1.1.0.

A new "Documentation Platform Standard" has been added to the "Key Standards" section.

The changes have been committed with the message:
`docs: add docusaurus standard to constitution`

I am ready for your next command.
