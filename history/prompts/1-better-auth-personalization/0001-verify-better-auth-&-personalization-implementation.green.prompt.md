## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

The agent verified that all tasks in the provided tasks.md file were already marked as complete. It performed prerequisite checks, loaded relevant documentation (plan.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, openapi.yml), and verified project setup (git, eslint configuration). No further implementation actions were required as all tasks were indicated as completed.
