## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

I have generated a `tasks.md` file that breaks down the process of writing Chapter 3 into a series of actionable tasks. The tasks are organized sequentially, starting with setting up the directory structure, followed by creating the content for each section of the chapter, and concluding with a polish phase.
