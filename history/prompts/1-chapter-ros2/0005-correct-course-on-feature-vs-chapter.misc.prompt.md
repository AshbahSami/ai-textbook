## Prompt

i didnt asked you to create ros2 this project is about book and chapter is ros2

## Response snapshot

You are absolutely right. My apologies for the misunderstanding. I will correct my course of action. The project is about writing a book, and the feature is a chapter about ROS 2.

I have successfully corrected the course of action. The feature has been renamed to `1-chapter-ros2` and the spec and plan have been updated to reflect that this is a chapter in a book, not a software feature.

The changes have been committed with the message:
`docs: correct course to book chapter`

I am ready for your next command.
