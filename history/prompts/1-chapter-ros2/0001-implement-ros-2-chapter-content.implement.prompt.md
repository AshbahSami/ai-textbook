## Response snapshot

The agent successfully executed the implementation plan as defined in tasks.md for the "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" chapter.
- Verified checklists status (all complete).
- Verified project setup (git repo detected, .gitignore reviewed).
- Created the chapter directory `temp-docusaurus-site/docs/chapter1/`.
- Created `index.md` for Chapter 1 with Docusaurus front-matter.
- Created all section files (1.1 to 1.6) for the chapter with Docusaurus front-matter and drafted initial content, including Python code examples where specified.
- The Docusaurus sidebar configuration `sidebars.js` was automatically updated due to the 'autogenerated' setting.
- All automated tasks from Phase 1 to Phase 7 are completed. Phase 8 (Review and Polish) tasks require manual review.
