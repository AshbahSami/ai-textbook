# Querying and Commanding: Services

While topics excel at continuous, one-to-many data streaming, sometimes you need a direct, synchronous request-response mechanism. This is where **Services** in ROS 2 come into play. Services allow a client node to send a request to a service server node, wait for the server to process the request, and then receive a single, corresponding response. This pattern is ideal for command-and-control operations, querying specific data, or triggering actions that require immediate confirmation.

## Synchronous Request-Response and State Management

The core characteristic of a ROS 2 service is its synchronous, blocking nature. When a client calls a service, it pauses its execution until the server provides a response. This makes services perfect for:

-   **Commanding specific actions**: "Open gripper," "Take a picture," "Move to coordinate X, Y."
-   **Querying information**: "What is the robot's battery level?", "Is the object detected?"
-   **State Management**: Setting a particular state on a device or component and getting confirmation that the state has been set.

Unlike topics, which are fire-and-forget, services guarantee that a request sent will (eventually) receive a response or indicate a failure. This reliability is crucial for critical operations where knowing the outcome is essential.

## Python Code Example: Client/Server Service

Let's create a simple ROS 2 service example using Python. We'll implement a `MinimalService` that adds two integers and a `MinimalClient` to request this addition.

First, ensure you have a ROS 2 package set up.

### The Service Server (`minimal_service.py`)

Create a file named `minimal_service.py` in your package:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts # Standard service type

class MinimalService(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_service')
        self.srv = self.create_service(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints', self.add_two_ints_callback)
        self.get_logger().info('Service server ready.')

    def add_two_ints_callback(self, request, response):
        response.sum = request.a + request.b
        self.get_logger().info(f'Incoming request: a={request.a} b={request.b}')
        self.get_logger().info(f'Sending back response: {response.sum}')
        return response

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_service = MinimalService()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_service)
    minimal_service.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

-   `self.create_service(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints', self.add_two_ints_callback)`: Creates a service server using the standard `AddTwoInts` service type, named `add_two_ints`, and specifies `add_two_ints_callback` as the function to handle requests.
-   The `add_two_ints_callback` function receives `request` and `response` objects, performs the addition, and populates `response.sum`.

### The Service Client (`minimal_client.py`)

Create a file named `minimal_client.py` in your package:

```python
import sys
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts # Standard service type

class MinimalClient(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_client')
        self.cli = self.create_client(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints')
        while not self.cli.wait_for_service(timeout_sec=1.0):
            self.get_logger().info('Service not available, waiting again...')
        self.req = AddTwoInts.Request()

    def send_request(self, a, b):
        self.req.a = a
        self.req.b = b
        self.future = self.cli.call_async(self.req)
        rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, self.future)
        return self.future.result()

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_client = MinimalClient()
    response = minimal_client.send_request(int(sys.argv[1]), int(sys.argv[2]))
    minimal_client.get_logger().info(
        f'Result of add_two_ints: for {sys.argv[1]} + {sys.argv[2]} = {response.sum}'
    )
    minimal_client.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print('Usage: ros2 run <your_package_name> minimal_client <arg1> <arg2>')
        sys.exit(1)
    main()
```

-   `self.create_client(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints')`: Creates a client for the `add_two_ints` service.
-   `self.cli.wait_for_service(timeout_sec=1.0)`: The client waits until the service server is available.
-   `self.future = self.cli.call_async(self.req)`: Sends the request asynchronously.
-   `rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, self.future)`: Blocks until the response is received.

### Running the Example

1.  **Ensure your ROS 2 environment is sourced.**
2.  **Make the scripts executable**: `chmod +x minimal_service.py minimal_client.py`
3.  **Run the service server in one terminal**: `ros2 run <your_package_name> minimal_service`
4.  **Run the client in another terminal**: `ros2 run <your_package_name> minimal_client 5 3` (replace 5 and 3 with desired numbers)

You will see the client send a request, the server process it, and the client receive and print the sum. Services provide a robust way to implement specific command-and-control interactions in your ROS 2 applications.
