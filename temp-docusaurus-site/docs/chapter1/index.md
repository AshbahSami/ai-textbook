# The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first chapter, where we will explore the foundational concepts of the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS 2). This chapter aims to establish the software communication framework essential for any advanced robotic system, including our humanoid project. We will dive into the core primitives of ROS 2, such as Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions, providing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation guidance for intermediate technical learners.

## In This Chapter

We will cover:
- **From Digital Brain to Physical Body: Introducing ROS 2**: Understanding what ROS 2 is and why it's crucial for robotics.
- **Designing the Robot’s Vocabulary: Custom Interfaces**: How robots communicate using messages, services, and actions.
- **The Heartbeat: Implementing Nodes and Topics**: Exploring asynchronous communication and continuous data streaming.
- **Querying and Commanding: Services**: Synchronous request-response patterns for state management.
- **Executing Complex Behaviors: Actions**: Managing long-running, cancellable tasks.
- **Assembling the Nervous System: Packages, Launch Files, and QoS**: Organizing your ROS 2 projects and ensuring reliable communication.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of ROS 2's core components and be able to set up a basic communication architecture for your robotic applications.
